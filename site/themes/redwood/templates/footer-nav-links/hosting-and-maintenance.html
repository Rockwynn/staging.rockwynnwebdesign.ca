<p>Your domain needs to be registered every year. We&#8217;re covering the first year, but subsequent years will cost:
$35 (.com, .org, .net)
Other domain extensions are available by request, rates may change without notice.</p>
<p>I will bill you one month prior to your domain expiring. If you do not renew your domain on time, I may still be able to save
    it for you, at an additional charge.</p>
<p>In the event of non-payment of your domain, you may lose your domain to another individual or business. In the case that another
    party purchases your domain, your only recourse is to attempt to contact the new owner and negotiate a purchase.</p>

<h3>Website Hosting & Maintenance</h3>
<p>The cost of hosting & maintaining your website is $600 per year, billed annually. Or $50.00 monthly.</p>
<p>I will provide you with minor updates, they should
    not exceed more than 50% of the content on any single site page. The maintenance plan includes 1 hour of work each month. If you request
    work that will take more than 1 hour in a given month, I&#8217;ll ask you to confirm your plans and bill you at $60.00 per hour. During
    this time, you agree that I will be the sole provider of maintenance services for your Website, and no other party will have access to or
    rights to change your Website. If a party other than myself makes changes to the Website, any errors that are created, that must be repaired
    will be charged for separately.</p>
<p>In the event of non-payment of your hosting fees, your hosting account will be suspended until payment is received. I am not required to
    store your website files on the servers if your payment is 30 days or more past due. Please notify me of your intention to cancel your
    hosting account prior to your files being deleted so I may provide you with a backup of your site for a $100 fee.</p>
