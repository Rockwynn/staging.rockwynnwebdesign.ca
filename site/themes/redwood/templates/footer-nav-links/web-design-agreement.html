<hr>
<p>Between us, Rockwynn Web Design and you _______________________________________________ (Customer name)</p>
</div>
<div class="mb-3 py-1">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I will always do my best to fulfill your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important
    to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when,
    and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won’t find any complicated
    legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. I have no desire to trick you into signing
    something that you might later regret. I want what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.</p>

</div>
<div class="mb-3 py-1">
<h3>In short…</h3>
<p>You _________________________________ located at ________________________________________</p>
<p>are hiring me Sandra White, Sole Proprietor of Rockwynn Web Design located at 3 Lansdown Street,
Sundridge Ontario to Design & Develop a Website for you, for the estimated total price of $_________,
as outlined in our Design & Development Proposal and Quote. I will also include 1 .ca Domain name and
1 domain name email for your first year in the quoted price above. Of course it’s a little more complicated,
but I’ll get to that.</p>
</div>
<div class="mb-3 py-1">
<h3>What both parties agree to do?</h3>
<p>As my client you have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company
    or your organization. You agree to provide me with everything that I need to complete the project
    as and when and in the format I need it. You’ll review my work, provide feedback and approval in
    a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you’ll also be bound by any dates we set together.
    You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.</p>
<p>I have the experience and ability to do everything I’ve agreed with you and I’ll do it all in a
    professional and timely manner. I will endeavor to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of
    that I’ll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give me.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-3 py-1">
<h3>Getting down to the nitty gritty</h3>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>I will create look-and-feel designs, and flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of many
    devices and screen sizes. I use Responsive Layout templates developed from HTML5 markup and CSS 3
    Style sheets for styling.  I create designs iteratively so I won’t waste time mocking up every
    template as a static visual. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to review the work and provide
    feedback. I’ll share the Staging Site with you and have regular, possibly daily contact. If, at
    any time, you’re not happy with the direction our work is taking, you’ll pay me in full for everything
    I have produced until that point and cancel this contract.</p>
<p>I know from experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit
    you to your earliest ideas. I don’t want to limit your ability to change your mind. The fixed price
    at the beginning of this contract is based on the number of pages and the length of time I estimate
    I’ll need to accomplish everything you’ve told me you want to achieve, but I’m happy to be flexible.
    If you do want to change your mind, add extra pages or templates or even add new functionality,
    that won’t be a problem as I’ll provide a separate estimate for that. Along the way I’ll ask you
    to put your requests in writing so I can keep track of changes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-3 py-1">
<h3>Page Content</h3>
<p>You are responsible for supplying all page content. Text content must be submitted in electronic
    format (.txt, .rtf, .doc) via google docs or email attachment, no faxes, scanned, or handwritten
    pages accepted. You wouldn't want to pay designer rates for steno work!!  Graphic files should
    be submitted in an editable, vector digital format, whenever possible. Photos should be in a high
    resolution digital format. If you’d like me to write new content, search for images or take photos
    for you, I can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-3 py-1">
<h3>Browser testing</h3>
<p>Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a Website look the same in browsers of different
    capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person’s experience
    of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-3 py-1">
<h3>Desktop browser testing</h3>
<p>I test the work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari),
    Google (Chrome), Microsoft and Firefox. I won’t be testing in old or abandoned
    browsers unless you specify otherwise.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-3 py-1">
<h3>Mobile browser testing</h3>
<p>Testing popular small-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a design is
    appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. I test the work in: iOS: Safari, Google Chrome
Android 4.x: Google Chrome and Firefox.</p>
</div>
<div class="mb-3 py-1">
<h3>Search Engine Registration</h3>
<p>I will optimize your project with appropriate titles, keywords and descriptions and after your Website
    launch, submit your project to Google Search Engine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-3 py-1">
<h3>Legal stuff</h3>
<p>I do not warrant the functions of the site will meet your expectations of site traffic or resulting
    business or that the operation of the web pages will be uninterrupted and / or error-free. I will not
    be held responsible for occasional downtime of email or project due to line interruptions, power outages
    and/or other circumstances beyond our control.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-3 py-1">
<h3>Copyrights</h3>
<p>First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by
    your good selves, or that you’ve permission to use them. Then, when you’re final payment has cleared,
    copyright will be automatically assigned as follows you’ll own the visual elements that we create for
    this project. We’ll give you source files and finished files. You own all elements of text, images and
    data you provided, unless someone else owns them. We’ll own the unique combination of these elements that
    constitutes a complete design and we’ll license that you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only,
    unless we agree otherwise. I can provide a separate estimate for that. </p>
<p>I love to show off our work and share what we’ve learned with other people, so I reserve the right, with your
    permission, to display and link to your project as part of our portfolio and to write about it on websites,
    in magazine articles and in books.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-3 py-1">
<h3>Payments & Timeline</h3>
<p>I am sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that I send you
    promptly.  As I am also sure you'll want to stay in good standing, you agree to stick tight to the
    following payment schedule.</p>
<p>1st Milestone:  30% of total fee upon signing of contract (Deposit Fee)</p>
<p>2nd Milestone: 40% of total fee</p>
<p>3rd Milestone: 30% Remainder of total fee plus any agreed upon additions</p>
<p>Phases, Milestones, Estimated Timelines & Dates are used to keep the project on track.</p>

<h3>Typical Turnaround Times</h3>
<p>Design Only 2-4 Weeks</p>
<p>Development Only 2-4 Weeks</p>
<p>Custom Theme 4-6 Weeks</p>
<p>Custom Theme with Interior Page Setup 6-8 Weeks</p>
<p>After your Project is completed, the Hosting & Maintenance Plan will begin.</p>
<p>If the total amount of this contract is less than $2000.00, the total amount shall be paid upon signing
    of the contract and any additional costs incurred during development will be invoiced at the completion
    of the project.</p>
<p>I do not place any interest on late payments because that’s no fun for anyone, but reserve the right to
    stop work on the project and withdraw any Staging Site or otherwise, up until the time any outstanding
    amount is settled. Hopefully this will not be the case.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-3 py-1">
<h3>But where is all the horrible small print?</h3>
<p>I can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so I can’t be liable to you or any third-party for
    damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even
    if you’ve advised us of them. Just like a parking ticket, you can’t transfer this contract to anyone else
    without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. </p>
<p>Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under
    exclusive jurisdiction of Canadian courts.</p>
